* The repo is created to create end points which generats fundamentals, generate forecast, analyze news and get summary, the fast api app is hosted on **heroku** https://investment-analyzer-fastapi-5e7e9fc21917.herokuapp.com/docs
* As we have deployed on heroku and some of the calls take more than 1 minute due to the complexity we need to use **Celery** worker configured with **Redis** to process background job, the background jobs are polled to get the results asynchronously. 
* Procfile can be referred to start fastapi app and celery worker.
* We use `langchain` and `gpt-4o-mini` for llm tasks.
* An Agent is used which uses Python Repel tool to execute code which is generated by llm, which helps in calculating financial fundamentals.
* New API is used to search for news for the given company.
* A final summary is genarated.
* Here is the frontend repo: https://github.com/gpaikane/stock-analyzer-frontend which is basically a streamlit app https://company-stock-evaluator-ab684352912d.herokuapp.com/ currently hosted on **heroku**
